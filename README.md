## Bug Report Management
​
Suppose you are testing a web application that allows users to create and share their own playlists. You have identified a bug where, when a user tries to add a song to their playlist, the song is not being added and an error message is displayed. The error message reads "Error: Unable to add song to playlist. Please try again later."  
​
​
Your task is to create a bug report that includes the following information:  
1. Steps to reproduce the bug
1. Expected behavior
1. Actual behavior
1. Screenshots (if applicable)
1. Any additional information that may be relevant  
​
​
Please include as much detail as possible so that the development team can easily reproduce and fix the bug.
